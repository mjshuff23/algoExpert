// Write a function `bestSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

// The function should return an array containing the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum

// If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest

function bestSum(targetSum, numbers) {}

console.log(bestSum(7, [4, 3, 7]));
console.log(bestSum(214, [5, 9, 20, 15, 17, 3, 1]));
