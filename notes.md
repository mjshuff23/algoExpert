# DSA Notes

- Consider visualizing as a tree
- Space complexity is not always the same as Time complexity
- Complexities from fastest to slowest:
  - O(1)       - Constant
  - O(log(n))  - Logarithmic
  - O(n)       - Linear
  - O(nlog(n)) - Loglinear, Linearithmic, Quasilinear
  - O(n^2)     - Quadratic
  - O(n^c)     - Polynomial, Algebraic
  - O(c^n)     - Exponential
  - O(n!)      - Factorial
